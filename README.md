# Mrk421_JetSet_fit

These four selected epochs SED fits of the blazar Markarian 421 were prepared using the data from Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS. The fits are made as a comparison to the study effectuated in the paper: 

<i>BalokoviÄ‡ et al., Multiwavelength study of quiescent states of Mrk 421 with unprecedented hard X-ray coverage provided by NuSTAR in 2013,
The Astrophysical Journal (2016)<i>

 
The analysis was made with JetSet framework in order to complete the report that will be soon published in the repository.
