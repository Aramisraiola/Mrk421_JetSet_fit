# Mrk421_JetSet_fit
These four selected epochs SED fits of the blazar Markarian 421 were prepared using the data from Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS. The fits are made as a comparison to the study effectuated in the paper: 
<i>BalokoviÄ‡ et al., Multiwavelength study of quiescent states of Mrk 421 with unprecedented hard X-ray coverage provided by NuSTAR in 2013,
The Astrophysical Journal (2016)<i>


JetSet framework is used in order to procede fitting the data.
