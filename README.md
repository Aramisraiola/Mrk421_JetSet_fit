# Mrk421_JetSet_fit

These four selected epochs SED fits of the blazar Markarian 421 were prepared using the data from Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS. The fits are made as a comparison to the study effectuated in the paper: 

<i> BalokoviÄ‡ et al., Multiwavelength study of quiescent states of Mrk 421 with unprecedented hard X-ray coverage provided by NuSTAR in 2013,
The Astrophysical Journal (2016) </i>

 
The analysis was made with JetSet framework in order to complete a report that will be soon published in the repository. The fits are adapted verions of the code present in the JetSet tutorial number 5.
