# Mrk421_JetSet_fit

These four selected epochs SED fits of the blazar Markarian 421 were prepared using the data from Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS. The fits are made as a comparison to the study effectuated in the paper: 

<i> BalokoviÄ‡ et al., Multiwavelength study of quiescent states of Mrk 421 with unprecedented hard X-ray coverage provided by NuSTAR in 2013,
The Astrophysical Journal (2016) </i>

 
The analysis was made with JetSet framework in order to complete a report that will be soon published in the repository. The fits are adapted verions of the code present in the JetSet tutorial number 5.

In every folder it is possible to find:
<ul>
  <li>The main code, as a jupyter notebook; </li>
  <li>The prefit as a .pkl file </li>
  <li>The data to be fit as a .ecsv file. </li>
</ul>
